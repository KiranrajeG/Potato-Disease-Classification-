Potato Disease Classification ðŸŒ±ðŸ¥” 

The Potato Disease Classification project leverages the EfficientNetB0 machine learning model to classify potato leaf images into three categories: Healthy, Late Blight, and Early Blight. The trained model is saved in .keras format and served through a FastAPI backend, with a user-friendly React.js frontend for interaction. Users can upload images of potato leaves, and the system quickly provides predictions to assist farmers in identifying diseases and improving crop health. The project aims to streamline disease detection and is a valuable tool for modern agriculture.
